# Introduction 

Across all these sketches we have a few TODO with instructions oh how to complete the exercise  
```
	/** TODO please complete this exercise */
```
I've added a few suggestions you can change like color, size, shapes and interactions.

```
 	/**  EXTRA cool stuff for awesome people */
```

# Exercise 1: Intro and Drawing shapes

For the first example we are just going to introduce you to processing and do a quick exercise to introduce you to programming. 

Please copy this into a new sketch/pde to start this exercise [Hello world](/Exercises/Hello_world/Hello_world.pde)

This demo is designed to get you comfortable with processing and how to draw a basic shape on the screen. This is the hello world of processing.


# Exercise 2: Drawing with for loops

For the second example we are just going to show you how to program with for loops.

# Exercise 3: Having fun with code
 
## Challenge for experts 

Take one of the of the previous examples or one of the examples below and change something about them. I've added a few hints in the sketches with ideas. This is the open part of the exercise where you can just play around with processing.
